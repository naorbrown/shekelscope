This concentration kills competition, raises prices, and creates a system where the connected get richer while everyone else pays more.",
        "rootCause": "Government-granted monopolies, regulatory capture, and barriers to entry protect incumbent businesses. Import quotas shield domestic producers from foreign competition. Banking concentration means fewer choices and higher fees. The same families sit on multiple boards across industries.",

        "rootCause": "High taxes (income + NI + health = ~35-45%), housing at 10.6x income, food 19% above EU, cars at 2x global price. Red tape and regulation inflate every cost. The result: Israel's 'competitive' tech salaries buy less than mid-range salaries in deregulated economies.",
